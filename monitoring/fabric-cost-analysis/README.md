# **Solution accelerator for Fabric platform to monitor cost**

The solution aims to facilitate the understanding and monitoring of the Microsoft Fabric Cost.

Customers may not always clearly distinguish between costs that are included or excluded within the Data Platform, the handling of reservations (particularly those not rationalized within a defined scope), or their capacity usage. They may also need guidance on strategies for optimizing resources and implementing effective FinOps practices, including chargeback and show back to stakeholders. This free solution was developed in France by several passionate CSA experts in FinOps and Data: [Cedric Dupui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdupui/), [Manel Omani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlomani/), [Antoine Richet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-richet-22a44021/), and led by [Romain Casteres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casteres/) inspired by his Blog article [FinOps for Microsoft Fabric](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finops-microsoft-fabric-romain-casteres-hc6ee/?trackingId=xFSs0xHqR0OheUQ7Tqn9mw%3D%3D).

## Introduction

Fabric Cost Analysis (short: FCA) is a solution to enable holistic monitoring of Microsoft Fabric Cost with the help of Microsoft Fabric.

FCA has the goal to provide a holistic view specified on Microsoft Fabric aspects and particularities (joining Financial and Operational forces) on top of the various information, which can be extracted from Azure Cost Management, personal enriched source of information, ‚Ä¶ allowing its users to analyze at a very high level, but also to deep dive into specific usage, reservations and particularity of the platform for a more finer data analysis.

FCA is fully developed utilizing Fabric capabilities, with Pipelines and Notebooks serving as key tools for data extraction and transformation. Data is maintained both in its raw format and as Delta Parquet, allowing users to access it directly through Power BI Direct Lake. FCA includes standard reports that provide an overview of data and allow users to customize or create their own reports using the data model. Fabric's open platform enables integration with external data sources for further analysis as needed.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: The FCA solution accelerator is not an official Microsoft product! It is a solution accelerator, which can help you implement a cost monitoring solution within and for Fabric. Consequently, there is no official support provided, and there remains a potential risk of failures.

### Architecture

![FCA](./media/FCASolutionArchitecture.png)

### FCA Inputs

FCA gathers diverse data in Lakehouse to provide cost insights:
- FCA extracts Azure Cost in [FOCUS](https://focus.finops.org/) format (a Unified Standard for Cloud Billing Data)
- FCA extracts enriched Microsoft Learn documentation data
- (optional) FCA extracts Azure Reservations details

‚ÑπÔ∏è Azure Cost export is available for various Azure account types, including Enterprise Agreement (EA) and Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) customers.

## Setup

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Are you ready to try FCA? Let's follow these simple steps:

### 1 - Configure export

#### 1.1 - FOCUS Data

‚ÑπÔ∏è FCA will retain only data related to Fabric costs, no other Azure cost will be kept.

> To create an export (Create [Cost Management exports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-improved-exports#create-exports)) the [Cost Management Contributor role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-work-scopes#roles-used-in-cost-management-on-rbac-scopes) will be required.

An Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is necessary for saving exported data, the following steps outline how to create a storage account: [Create a storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/create-data-lake-storage-account).

Once Data Lake Gen 2 storage account created here are the high levels steps to create an export:
- Sign into the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/), search for **Cost Management**
- Select the required scope and select **Exports** in the left navigation menu
- Select **+ Create**
- On the Basics tab, select the template = **Cost and usage (FOCUS)**

### 3 - Run the Pipeline

- Open the **Load FCA E2E** Data pipeline and Run the Pipeline once

![Load FCA E2E Notebook](./media/Setup_NotebookExecution.png)

‚ÑπÔ∏è The parameters "FromMonth" and "ToMonth" in the Data pipeline can be configured to specify the historical time frame of data processing. For example, setting FromMonth = -3 and ToMonth = 0 will load data from the previous three months.

The pipeline can be scheduled for daily loads ([Scheduled data pipeline runs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/pipeline-runs#scheduled-data-pipeline-runs)).
In case of **Daily runs**, configure "FromMonth" = 0 and "ToMonth" = 0.
In case of **Weekly or Monthly runs**, configure "FromMonth" = -1 and "ToMonth" = 0.

### 4 - Open the report

- Navigate to your FCA workspace.

- Search for the item FCA_Core_Report.

- Open the FCA_Core_Report Power BI report.

- Feel free to explore the report pages

‚ÑπÔ∏è Refresh the SQL Endpoint of the Lakehouse and update the semantic model in case of errors.

### 5 - (Optional) Create the Data Agent

Since it's required additional prerequisites, the creation of the Data Agent is optional ([Data Agent prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/how-to-create-data-agent#prerequisites)).

Steps to create the Data Agent:
- Open the **02_Create_DataAgent** Notebook
