> [!CAUTION]  
> The FUAM solution accelerator is not an official Microsoft product! It is a solution accelerator, which can help you implement a monitoring solution within Fabric. As such there is no offical support available and there is a risk that things might break. E.g. the extraction of Capacity Metrics data. This is based on the Capacity Metrics App and elements of that App could change without notice and impact FUAM.


## Introduction

Fabric Unified Admin Monitoring (short: FUAM) is a solution to enable holistic monitoring on top of Microsoft Fabric. Today, monitoring for Fabric can be done through different reports, apps, and tools.

FUAM aims to provide a more holistic view on top of the various information that can be extracted from Fabric, allowing its users to analyze at a very high level, but also to deep dive into specific items for more fine-grained data analysis.

FUAM is completely built with Fabric capabilities, with Pipelines and Notebooks as the main tools to extract and transform data. All the data is stored in its raw format, but also in Delta Parquet, enabling the user to directly use it through Power BI Direct Lake or the Lakehouse SQL Endpoint via SQL. FUAM comes with a set of standard reports enabling a quick overview of the data, but it's intended to give users all the tools to customize or build their own reports on top of the data model. Through the openness of Fabric, it's also possible to combine it with your own data, enabling you to do the analysis you wish.


## FUAM Content

FUAM extracts the following data from the tenant:

- Tenant Settings
- Delegated Tenant Settings
- Activities
- Workspaces
- Capacities
- Capacity Metrics
- Tenant meta data (Scanner API)
- Capacity Refreshables
- Git Connections
- Engine level insights (coming soon in optimization module)



### Architecture

The architecture of FUAM is built on Fabric items like Pipelines, Notebooks, Lakehouses, Semantic Models, and Power BI reports. We have built the component in a modular structure, which helps you extend FUAM with your own modules. This architectural design also makes the solution easier to maintain.

The data ingestion logic is orchestrated and parameterizable, which allows us to use the main orchestration pipeline for initial and incremental data loads. FUAM Lakehouse is one of the core components in the architecture. All the data is transformed and persisted in a way that opens up amazing capabilities for analyzing the collected data in a semantic model with DirectLake mode.

### Benefits
- Modular building blocks
- One-source-of-truth approach
- End-to-end report experience
- Intelligent optimization module (coming soon)
- Long term CU utilization analysis
- Bring your own data & enrich FUAM with your data
